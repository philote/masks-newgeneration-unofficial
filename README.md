The content from this module is from **Masks: A New Generation** from **Magpie Games**. You can get the PDF at: https://magpiegames.com/masks/

This revised version of the module is based on works from multiple people: 
- The original created by brunocalado (https://github.com/brunocalado/masks-newgeneration-unofficial) 
- A second version that was maintained by CyricPL (https://github.com/CyricPL/masks-newgeneration-unofficial)
- A sheet module created by Geekswordsman (https://gitlab.com/geekswordsman/masks-newgeneration-sheets)
The current version is a merging of these modules' features, cleanup of the moves and bringing the module up to date with Foundry VTT versions and PbtA system versions.

If you’ve enjoyed my work and find value in what I create, please consider supporting me with a small donation on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/G2G3I91JQ). I truly love what I do, and your support helps me dedicate time and resources to ongoing development. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a difference and allows me to continue doing what I’m passionate about. Thank you for considering—it means the world to me.
