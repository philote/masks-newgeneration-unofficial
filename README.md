The content from this module is from **Masks: A New Generation** from **Magpie Games**. You can get the PDF at: https://magpiegames.com/masks/

This revised version of the module is based on works from multiple people: 
- The original created by brunocalado (https://github.com/brunocalado/masks-newgeneration-unofficial) 
- A second version that was maintained by CyricPL (https://github.com/CyricPL/masks-newgeneration-unofficial)
- A sheet module created by Geekswordsman (https://gitlab.com/geekswordsman/masks-newgeneration-sheets)
The current version is a merging of these modules' features, cleanup of the moves and bringing the module up to date with Foundry VTT versions and PbtA system versions.
