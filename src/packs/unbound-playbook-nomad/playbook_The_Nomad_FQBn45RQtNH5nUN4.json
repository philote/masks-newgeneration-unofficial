You devote yourself, here and now, to a cause, and you achieve your goal in ways that you never could’ve if you’d only stayed home. Of course, now you’ve proved to everyone that you really don’t belong here, and the very skills that let you succeed are the ones you earned from out there...</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Nomad Moves</h2>\n<p><em>(Choose two)</em></p>\n<div>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.unbound-playbook-nomad.Item.QFsDRHG48Ak6alnL]{No Good At Being A Kid}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.unbound-playbook-nomad.Item.wu6HgKNHy27krvTx]{Watched C-Beams Glitter}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.unbound-playbook-nomad.Item.Fe0pgzg2BSZmk0oh]{I Hate Calling the Cavalry}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.unbound-playbook-nomad.Item.r4WZHDUdLRewPUcN]{The Littlest Space Bandit}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.unbound-playbook-nomad.Item.UTHT0PazrgCEIKGC]{Out Of This World}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.unbound-playbook-nomad.Item.evojX8BAiWelkDnQ]{Sharpened Eyes}</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Putting Down Roots</h2>\n<p>You have one foot out the door, and it shows.

The Nomad has seen things that their peers can’t even imagine. They’ve seen the universe at play. They’ve encountered other cultures and ideas, and they have their own collection of cool toys. And for all that awesomeness, the Nomad has never had their own home or family. Their story is all about connecting deeply to the people and world around them, instead of bouncing off to something new and different.</p>\n<p>The two crucial questions for the Nomad during character creation are “What brought you back to stay (for now)?” and “Why do you care about the team?” The Nomad only works because they have chosen to remain with the team—if they followed their wanderlust, they wouldn’t be part of a <strong>MASKS</strong> game.</p>\n<p>Make sure that between these two questions, your Nomad has clear, durable reasons to stick with the team. “I came back to stay because I need to get a flux capacitor to repay my debt to the Pirate Queen of Orion” is a cool answer, but not a durable answer—as soon as the Nomad gets the flux capacitor, they can go back to space. “I came back to stay because I’m wanted across space for a crime I didn’t commit” is better—as long as you remain wanted, you’re stuck on Earth, and there’s no clear path to having that status changed.</p>\n<p>Finally, your extra, <span class=\"special\">Putting down roots</span>, has you uniquely playing with Influence. You are incentivized to give out Influence, for all the benefits you get—but remember, you can only give out Influence to six characters total, including teammates. Some of the benefits are much more advantageous when you give Influence to an enemy than when you give it to an ally, too. And while you can take back Influence at the end of every session, it’s otherwise pretty hard to shift it around once you’ve given it out. Balancing the tension between wanting to give out your Influence and picking exactly the right people to give it to is at the heart of the whole playbook—so have fun with it!</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Out of this world</span>, what it means to plug into the cosmic aether is up to you. Maybe you listen to some weird music you picked up out in space; maybe you burn some transdimensional incense and meditate. Whatever you choose, it should be consistent—it shouldn’t shift every time you do it.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Putting down roots</span>, all rules not called out as different here function as normal. For example, those you give Influence to can still shift your Labels, and you can still reject their Influence. Your benefits are based on how many other characters have Influence over you—meaning that if you take Influence over you away from other characters, you may lose some of those benefits.</p>\n<p>Note that you do not have an advancement to retire or become a paragon; instead, you depart for reaches unknown, never to return. If you wish to retire or become a paragon, you must change playbooks first and become someone more settled, and less nomadic.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>INSPIRATION FOR THE NOMAD</h3>\n<p>Cammi Benally, <strong>AVENGERS ARENA/UNDERCOVER</strong></p>\n<p>Marvel Boy, <strong>YOUNG AVENGERS</strong></p>\n<p>America Chavez, <strong>YOUNG AVENGERS/AMERICA</strong></p>\n<p>The Doctor, <strong>DOCTOR WHO</strong></p>\n<p>Star-Lord, <strong>GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY</strong></p>\n<p>Blink, <strong>EXILES</strong></p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>",
