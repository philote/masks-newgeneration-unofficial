If you cause a misunderstanding, collateral damage, or unintended consequences in the process, mark potential. When you r<strong>eject one of your lessons</strong>, reject its Influence as if it were an NPC. If you choose to have it lose Influence over you, erase that lesson and write a new one in its stead.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>approach your creator or caretakers with a problem</strong>, tell them what obstacle you face or what you need to achieve, and they will offer you something you need.
