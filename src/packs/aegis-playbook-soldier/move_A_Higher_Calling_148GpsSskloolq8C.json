    "description": "<p>You work for a metahuman law enforcement agency (A.E.G.I.S.) that keeps the world safe from all manner of superhuman, supernatural, and extraterrestrial threats. You volunteered to work with a team of young superheroes as part of a new A.E.G.I.S. program designed to keep Halcyon City safe.</p>\n<p>You have an additional Label: Soldier, starts at +2</p>\n<p>Soldier functions like any other Label. Characters with Influence over you can shift it, and you mark a condition if it would ever shift above +3 or below -2. You can only cancel the influence A.E.G.I.S. holds over you with the appropriate advancement. You cannot lock Soldier with a Moment of Truth.</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re <strong>acting on orders and relying on your training</strong>, give A.E.G.I.S. influence to use Soldier instead of any other Label when you make a basic or playbook move.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>invoke your authority over civilians, Halcyon City personnel, or A.E.G.I.S. staff</strong>, roll + Soldier. On a 7+, your words carry weight. On a 7-9, someone will push back against your instructions or orders...sooner rather than later. On a 6-, your attempts to control the situation create an opportunity for your enemies within A.E.G.I.S. to act against you.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>ask A.E.G.I.S. for additional resources, equipment, or information during a mission</strong>, roll + Soldier. On a 7+, they&rsquo;ll resupply you as best they can. On a 10+, the resources are highly classified or experimental; take +1 ongoing to deploying them throughout the mission. On a 6-, A.E.G.I.S. sends what they think you need, regardless of what you actually requested.</p>",
