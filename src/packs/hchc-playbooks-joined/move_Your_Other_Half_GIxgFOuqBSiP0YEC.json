    "description": "<p>You share a deep bond with your other half. You are stronger together than you are apart, for now. If your other half is a Delinquent, Outsider, or Transformed, take two moves from their playbook: one they have and one they don&rsquo;t. Remember that you share much beyond your moves; i.e., if your other half is an Outsider, you both hail from the same dimension/planet/etc. For all other playbooks, you share in the core extras of your other half.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beacon:</strong> Take drives and mark four of your choice. When your other half strikes out a drive, strike it out as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Bull:</strong> Take The Bull&rsquo;s Heart with the same love and rival as your other half. Choose a different role that you commonly fulfill.</li>\n<li><strong>Janus:</strong> Take The Mask and a secret identity. Choose a different Label for your Mask. Take two obligations: one shared, one unique to you.</li>\n<li><strong>Legacy: </strong>Take a legacy. Your other half fills in as many names in the initial list as they choose; you fill in the rest. You can never answer the questions for your other half&rsquo;s Legacy move.</li>\n<li><strong>Protégé:</strong> You share a mentor with your other half. When they finish defining your mentor and resources, choose an additional resource.</li>\n<li><strong>Doomed:</strong> Take a sanctuary, a doom, and a doom track: You and your other half share the conditions that bring your doom closer and a doom track; when it fills, you both choose a new doomsign. You start with the doomsign your other half chose. Your other half picks the initial features and downsides of your shared sanctuary. You choose one more of each.</li>\n<li><strong>Nova:</strong> Take burn and four flares, two shared and two unique to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
