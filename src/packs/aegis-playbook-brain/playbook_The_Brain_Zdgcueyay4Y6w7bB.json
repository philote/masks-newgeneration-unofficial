That’s when somebody like you, gifted as you are with a peerless intellect, can rise to the occasion. Your plan, your invention, or your lightning-fast thought processes save the day, in a way no one else could have foreseen. Of course, after you’ve shown how different you are from them, that distance between you and the others is now that much greater.

It could have been something you invented when you first came into your genius, or something you set into motion that you no longer have the power to stop. It may even be something beyond your ability to achieve again, this once-in-a-lifetime creation. Just as you are a world-class intellect, your shame is a world-class problem.

The Brain is a once-in-an-era kind of mind, and they know it. They have the potential to completely change the world. It’s a terrible burden and an invigorating hope.</p>\n<p>Maybe once upon a time, the Brain could invent, create, and remake the world without thinking of the consequences or costs. But now the Brain is aware of both their responsibility to better the world, and the potential risks of their inventions gone awry. Play with these three poles of the Brain—the wanton inventor, the burdened world-fixer, and the guilty creator.</p>\n<p>You may think you should automatically be going after your Shame, but every time you are confronted with it, you are likely to suffer. Don’t worry that it won’t come into play if you avoid it—you can rest assured that your GM won’t miss out on an opportunity to bring your Shame to bear.</p>\n<p>With that said, you should definitely try to solve every single other problem you can get your hands on. You’re a genius, after all! The Brain is expected to butt into other people’s problems. You don’t want to become obnoxious to your fellow players, but trying to intervene in your teammates’ affairs on their behalf will draw attention to their story, while also giving them ample opportunity to tell you off and adjust your Labels.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Brain’s abilities work a bit similarly to the Nova’s in general concept—your brilliance is such that you can normally bend it to solve any given super-problem with gadgetry and invention. That said, keep in mind that your body is not particularly powerful, and with all your gadgets stripped away, you’re largely at the mercy of more physically powerful enemies.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Above the fray</span>, none of those triggers work if you are the leader.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Mission debrief</span>, deciding when you are “debriefing” is down to you and your group. If someone is telling you how you could’ve done better in a fight, then you’re probably in a debrief.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Logical angle</span>, “rationally pointing out their mistakes so they can do better next time” means that, from your perspective, you are genuinely trying to help. If they don’t like your help, they can just refuse to open up to you.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Scientific insight</span>, you may invent a crazy name for your scientific discipline if you so choose. If you don’t take this move, that doesn’t mean you are not a genius—it just means you don’t have mastery over a specific field.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Always prepared</span>, you can only restock when you would reasonably have access to supplies and equipment. It doesn’t have to be access to your own personal workshop, but it has to have supplies and parts that you can use, at minimum. When you restock, you only hold up to 2-gadgets—so if you already have 2-gadgets, you don’t get any more. Also, you can only spend 1-gadget when you introduce a new gadget—not when you reuse one you’ve already introduced. You should constantly be inventing new gadgets.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Tactical genius</span>, the “obvious flaw” can be something you, the player, make up in that moment. It’s only “obvious” to the genius mind of the Brain... and on a miss, it was never a true flaw at all.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>INSPIRATION FOR THE BRAIN</h3>\n<p>Shuri, <strong>BLACK PANTHER</strong></p>\n<p>Riri Williams and Tony Stark, <strong>MOON GIRL AND DEVIL DINOSAUR</strong></p>\n<p>Lunella Lafayette, <strong>MOON GIRL AND DEVIL DINOSAUR</strong></p>\n<p>Nadia Pym, <strong>THE UNSTOPPABLE WASP</strong></p>\n<p>Amadeus Cho, <strong>CHAMPIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Reed Richards, <strong>FANTASTIC FOUR</strong></p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>",
