It could have been something you invented when you first came into your genius, or something you set into motion that you no longer have the power to stop. It may even be something beyond your ability to achieve again, this once-in-a-lifetime creation. Just as you are a world-class intellect, your shame is a world-class problem. Whatever the case may be, your role in its creation is not publicly known...yet.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your shame?</strong></p>\n<p>❑ A prototype AI</p>\n<p>❑ A cosmic phenomenon</p>\n<p>❑ A catastrophic weapon</p>\n<p>❑ A dangerous chemical</p>\n<p>❑ A living monstrosity</p>\n<p>❑ An altered former ally</p>\n<p><strong>Whenever you are confronted with your shame</strong>, either mark a condition or shift Superior down and Danger up. If your shame is an NPC, they can never lose Influence over you.</p>\n<p><strong>At the end of every session</strong>, answer the question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did you take steps to make amends for your shame?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the answer is yes, mark potential. If the answer is no, give Influence to one of your teammates.</p>",
