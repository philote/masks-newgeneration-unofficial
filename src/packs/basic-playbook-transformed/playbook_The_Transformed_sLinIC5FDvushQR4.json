The Transformed used to be human, without any powers or superhuman elements, until something happened and they were changed, obviously and permanently. They might be a cyborg, or a strange monster, or made of electricity—just so long as they’re strange and inhuman, with no way of hiding it. The Transformed’s story is about what you do with your new life and form, and how you react to the way other people treat you now.</p>\n<p>Make the details of your abilities strange and surprising. If you have impenetrable armor, it could be just straight up armored plating, like a lizard— or it could be a layer of water over your entire body that slows down any impact coming your way. If you have superhuman senses, it could be that you can see and hear really well—or it could be that you have strange antenna that can actually detect the thoughts of sentient minds. Be grotesque, and play with it.</p>\n<p>As the Transformed, lots of people will attempt to shift your Labels, just by how they react to your appearance. You’re the quintessential book, and your cover is pretty striking—other people will judge you by it all the time, whether you like it or not. Your story is about how your actions either change or confirm those opinions. You can prove those people wrong—or you can prove them right. It’s your choice.</p>\n<p>Pay close attention to your backstory questions while building your character. You’re not the Bull, whose past is muddy and unclear—you had a life, and you remember it clearly. It’s important to know who you were so that everyone at the table knows who you might be now. It’s especially important that you answer the third question, about someone outside of the team who is helping you understand your new body. This character is your link to further developments specifically on your transformation. Whether it’s learning about what your transformation means, how it happened, what you can really do, or how to change back, they’re going to play an important role in your story.</p>\n<p>It’s theoretically possible for you to change yourself back over the course of play—after all, everything and anything is possible within Halcyon City. But keep in mind that doing so will be very difficult—you have no tools to point out such a path for yourself—and it requires you to change playbooks, or retire your character at the very least. Your character’s arc and struggles aren’t really about trying to return to what you were—they’re about trying to deal with what you are now.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">I am not my body</span>, you don’t just roll to <span class=\"special\">take a powerful blow</span> at -2—if you have no conditions marked, you’ll still roll at a 0, not a -2.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Not human enough</span>, what counts as a “terrifying way” is up to you and the GM, but the GM might push you on it to make sure you’re doing something actually terrifying.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Coming for you</span>, if it’s not immediately obvious who’s to blame for a given condition you mark, don’t worry about it and don’t bother to keep track—you’ll mark plenty of conditions, so just worry about the times when it’s a pretty clear choice. Remember that +1 forward is only a +1 on the very next move you make against them, whatever it is.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Be the monster</span>, there might be times when it doesn’t make sense that you could frighten or intimidate another individual—the GM lets you know if that happens. Otherwise, though, the move should trigger whenever you do something outright meant to provoke fear. It is not impossible for you to trigger the move accidentally, but the vast majority of the time it should be the result of intentional effort to be frightening.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>SUGGESTED MOVES FROM OTHER PLAYBOOKS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"special\">You’ve got a head you don’t need</span>, from the Bull playbook. Take this if you want to have a somewhat softer option than <span class=\"special\">Be the monster</span> for cowing people into doing what you want.</li>\n<li><span class=\"special\">Troublemaker</span>, from the Delinquent playbook. Take this if you want to emphasize how destructive and dangerous you can be, even when you’re trying to help your teammates.</li>\n<li><span class=\"special\">Game face</span>, from the Janus playbook. Take this if you want to commit to taking down particularly powerful foes, or saving the people who matter to you, no matter what.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>INSPIRATION FOR THE TRANSFORMED</h3>\n<p>Cyborg, <strong>TEEN TITANS</strong></p>\n<p>Mettle, <strong>AVENGERS ACADEMY</strong></p>\n<p>Beast, <strong>X-MEN</strong></p>\n<p>The Hulk, <strong>THE INCREDIBLE HULK</strong></p>\n<p>Rockslide, <strong>WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN</strong></p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>",
