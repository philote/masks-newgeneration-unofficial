The Bull’s a heavy hitter with big feelings. They get into a lot of fights, both interpersonal and superheroic, especially thanks to their signature move, <span class=\"special\">The Bull’s Heart</span>. A lot of the time, they’ll be Angry. They’re a big, gruff wrecking ball, and you should have fun smashing them into things. Aim for fights, emotional and physical! Be blunt! That’s the way of the Bull.</p>\n<p>Your biggest asset in playing your Bull is your core move, <span class=\"special\">The Bull’s Heart</span>. It’s your way of signaling to yourself and the whole table that you’re interested in scenes with particular characters. Pay attention to it, and try to get those bonuses as much as possible.</p>\n<p>When you’re building your Bull, keep your backstory in mind. By default a Bull was made into a weapon by someone, and you escaped from them. Be sure to describe what you know, without filling in every detail—you’re handing tools over to the GM so they can spotlight your character in cool ways.</p>\n<p>Every playbook’s Moment of Truth matters and may shift the direction of the character, but the Bull’s in particular is significant. When you use your Moment of Truth, the story of the Bull’s origins becomes way more important. Use your Moment of Truth when you know you want to make that backstory element unignorable.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>You can change the subjects of <span class=\"special\">The Bull’s Heart</span> pretty easily, which lets you make sure it’s always pointed at characters you’re interested in engaging. Do that, all the time. Even switching your rival to your love and vice versa is a good choice to keep things fresh and interesting. Other PCs are usually more interesting sources of drama and conflict than NPCs, but focus on the character relationships you find most interesting. If you aren’t spending time pursuing either your rivalry or your love, then switch as soon as you can.</p>\n<p>Also, keep in mind that your love doesn’t have to be a romantic love, and your rival doesn’t have to be hated. They absolutely can be if that’s what you want! But they don’t have to be so extreme. Your rival could be your closest friend whom you’re determined to surpass. Your love might be someone who’s like your younger sibling, and you keep them safe at all costs. Interpret those</p>\n<p>terms liberally—that’s why <span class=\"special\">The Bull’s Heart</span> roles, like Friend, still make sense. You would <span class=\"special\">comfort or support</span> your rival if they’re not just an enemy.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget your +1 ongoing to either impress your love or frustrate your rival! Chances are you’re going to be doing those things anyway, so you might as well get the extra benefit for it.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Punch everyone</span>, charging into a fight without hedging your bets means dashing into danger without any thought to your own safety or the safety of others. It needs to be meaningful that you aren’t hedging your bets or thinking about what you’re doing. Often, that means you aren’t participating in the move to generate Team for the fight.</p>\n<p><span class=\"special\">There when it matters</span> allows you to appear in a scene you weren’t previously in—just work with the GM to explain how you got there so quickly. It could be anything from you just happening to be in the area to you actively tailing the person you protect.</p>\n<p>For <span class=\"special\">Thick and thin skinned</span>, you can’t normally just choose to mark Angry whenever you want, so put yourself in situations where that particular button is likely to get pushed.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>SUGGESTED MOVES FROM OTHER PLAYBOOKS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"special\">Been reading the files</span>, from the Protégé playbook. Take this if you want to play into your past as a living weapon made by others—you can easily assume that they planted knowledge of potential foes in your head.</li>\n<li><span class=\"special\">Mary Contrary</span>, from the Delinquent playbook. Take this if you want your Bull to be especially hard to read and gruff.</li>\n<li><span class=\"special\">Not human enough</span>, from the Transformed playbook. Take this if you want to double down on your character’s frightening side—and if you want to be able to easily mark Angry for <span class=\"special\">Thick and thin skinned</span>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>INSPIRATION FOR THE BULL</h3>\n<p>Ms. America Chavez, <strong>YOUNG AVENGERS</strong></p>\n<p>Superboy, <strong>YOUNG JUSTICE</strong></p>\n<p>X-23, <strong>X-MEN</strong></p>\n<p>Molly Hayes, <strong>RUNAWAYS</strong></p>\n<p>Hazmat, <strong>AVENGERS ACADEMY</strong></p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>",
