On a 7+, you connect who they are now to who they are in the future; choose the role that they fulfill in the future, and the GM will tell you about their future self. On a 10+, ask a follow-up question. On a 6-, they&rsquo;re not at all who you thought they would be; the GM will choose their role, or tell you that as far as you know, they don&rsquo;t exist in the future.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Monster:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Traitor:</p>\n<p>Corruptor:</p>\n<p>Martyr:</p>\n<p>Architect:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Leader:&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Your Memories score starts at -1, and goes up by 1 (to a maximum of +3) for each name above.</p>\n<p><strong>When you write a name above</strong>, they gain Influence over you if they did not already have it.</p>\n<p><strong>At the start of each session or when time passes</strong>, roll + Savior to find out how your investigations into the timeline have been going. On a 7+, choose one figure noted above or one aspect of the future world you can remember. You&rsquo;ve found a lead to follow to learn more about how the present version of that figure or aspect became the future version. On a 10+, the lead is particularly strong; right now, you can ask the GM one question about the figure or aspect, and they will answer honestly. On a 6-, you&rsquo;re lost in the present; the GM will tell you how things are so different here, and shift your Labels according to how it makes you feel.</p>",
