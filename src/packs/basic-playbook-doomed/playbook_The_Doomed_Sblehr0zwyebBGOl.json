The Doomed is a character best served by long-term play, even though their story is about time pressure and not knowing how long they have left. They’re the only character who starts with a clear-cut enemy—their nemesis—and a dangerous timer on their character’s lifespan. They’re also the only character that explicitly faces death by the end of their story. As a result, adding a Doomed to your campaign inherently adds a level of drama, gloom, and danger to your game—death, while not a constant element, is now on the table.</p>\n<p>If you’re playing the Doomed, you may feel a desire to avoid using your doomsigns or to stay away from the triggers that advance your doom track. Don’t! Embrace those pieces of your character. Filling your doom track gives you doomsigns; doomsigns give you more power; and that power demands a purpose. By default, you can rely on your nemesis to provide you with a purpose, something to strive against, but you can aim for other things, too. Be ready to pay a lot of costs along the way to accomplishing your goals, whether through your sanctuary or other means.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>When you pick the two triggers that bring your doom closer, pick actions you’re interested in undertaking, not things you’re interested in avoiding. The GM will help stay alert for when you bring your doom closer, but you’re primarily in charge of watching for the triggers—so make sure you’re invested in them.</p>\n<p>For Infinite Powers, you can use an ability from any playbook—meaning, one of the abilities listed at the front of each playbook, like acrobatics or telekinesis. This doomsign gives you temporary access to new powers, so you can unleash your powers or directly engage in new ways.</p>\n<p>For Portal, you can appear in a scene with any one other character you name—whoever else is there is down to the fiction and the GM’s choice.</p>\n<p>The last doomsign, “Your doom arrives; confront it and perish,” triggers the end of your Doomed’s story. It means that whatever their doom is at that point finally arrives, and they can’t overcome it. They’re lost to it. The full end may not happen instantaneously, but it should happen by the end of the session (or</p>\n<p>the next) in which the Doomed marks this final doomsign. Once it’s marked, nothing can stop the Doomed from perishing.</p>\n<p>When you <span class=\"special\">call on the resources of your sanctuary to solve a problem</span>, those resources should dictate the conditions the GM imposes on you. Often, you’ll have to add some additional resource to your sanctuary to get the job done. If your sanctuary is intricately tied with your doom, then almost always using it to solve a problem should require you to mark your doom track.</p>\n<p>When you take the advance “Clear a doomsign,” you erase one marked doomsign. That means you have to fill your doom track again to retake it. You lose access to one of your powers, but you delay the arrival of your final doom.</p>\n<p>When you take the advance “Confront your doom on your terms; if you survive, change playbooks,” it means you’re forcing a confrontation with your doom...but you get to define the terms. You might confront your doom and overcome it purely over the course of play—in which case, the GM might say it’s appropriate that you simply mark off this advance and change playbooks. But if you select this advance, you choose to force the issue. You aren’t guaranteed to survive that final confrontation—only to have a chance at victory.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>SUGGESTED MOVES FROM OTHER PLAYBOOKS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"special\">Alien tech</span>, from the Outsider playbook. Take this if you want your Doomed to have the ability to create artifacts on the fly—just reinterpret “alien tech” to match the specifics of your doom and powerset.</li>\n<li><span class=\"special\">Be the monster</span>, from the Transformed playbook. Take this if you want to play up the scary side of your Doomed and how frightening your powers are when they manifest.</li>\n<li><span class=\"special\">Physics? What physics?</span>, from the Bull playbook. Take this if you want to emphasize Danger over Freak when you’re using your powers.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>INSPIRATION FOR THE DOOMED</h3>\n<p>Veil, <strong>AVENGERS ACADEMY</strong></p>\n<p>Raven, <strong>TEEN TITANS</strong></p>\n<p>Rachel Summers, <strong>X-MEN</strong></p>\n<p>Monster Girl, <strong>INVINCIBLE</strong></p>\n<p>Velocidad, <strong>GENERATION HOPE</strong></p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>",
