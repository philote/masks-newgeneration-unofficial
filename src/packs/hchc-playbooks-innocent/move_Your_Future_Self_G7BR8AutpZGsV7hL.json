Pick one step of your future self &rsquo;s path that you already know about, and circle it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They lost someone they cared about deeply</li>\n<li>They failed horrifically in a noble pursuit or cause</li>\n<li>They committed a major crime</li>\n<li>They betrayed a close friend or ally</li>\n<li>They won a victory at enormous cost to the world around them</li>\n<li>They killed someone</li>\n<li>They publicly battled another hero</li>\n<li>They injured an innocent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you <strong>learn of another step of your future self &rsquo;s path</strong>, circle it. You can have at most 5 steps circled. When you undergo an experience that echoes one of the above (your call), strike it out.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>strike out a circled step</strong>, or <strong>circle a struck out step</strong>, choose one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace comfort or support with the following: When you coldly dismiss someone, roll + Mundane. On a hit, they mark a condition or leave you alone, their choice. On a 7-9, they can also choose to inflict a condition on you.</li>\n<li>Replace defend someone with the following: When you aggressively defend a large group or area, roll + Savior. On a hit, you create an opportunity for yourself to press the attack, and take +1 forward to pursue it. On a 10+, the collateral damage is minimal.</li>\n<li>Replace provoke someone with the following: When you threaten someone, say what you want them to do and roll + Superior. On a hit, they either do it or they are put at a significant disadvantage against you, their choice. On a 10+, either way they mark a condition, your choice.</li>\n<li>Replace reject someone&rsquo;s Influence with the following: When you spit in the face of guidance or Influence, roll + 2. On a hit, take away their Influence over you or clear a condition, your choice. On a 7-9, you both take a powerful blow from the intensity of your words.</li>\n<li>Become an NPC antagonist&mdash;your path is irreconcilably set along the same course that your future self followed.</li>\n</ul>",
