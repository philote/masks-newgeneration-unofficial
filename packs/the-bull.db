{"_id":"nl4Im7KgfatfokcK","name":"THE BULL","type":"playbook","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"name":"","description":"<h2>THE BULL</h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;re big, strong, and tough. You know what fighting really is, and you&rsquo;re good at it. Sure&hellip;you&rsquo;ve got a soft side, too. But you only show that to the people you care about most. Everybody else? They can eat your fist.</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Bull|page=1]{The Bull}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE BULL</h2>\n<p>Gruff, tough, passionate, big-hearted. The Bull&rsquo;s a heavy hitter with big feelings. They get into a lot of fights, both interpersonal and superheroic, especially thanks to their signature move, The Bull&rsquo;s Heart. A lot of the time, they&rsquo;ll be Angry. They&rsquo;re a big, gruff wrecking ball, and you should have fun smashing them into things. Get into fights, emotional and physical! Be blunt! That&rsquo;s the way of the Bull. Your biggest asset in playing your Bull is your core move, The Bull&rsquo;s Heart. It&rsquo;s your way of signaling to yourself and the whole table that you&rsquo;re interested in scenes with particular characters. Pay attention to it, and try to get those bonuses as much as possible. Every playbook&rsquo;s Moment of Truth matters and may shift the direction of the character, but the Bull&rsquo;s in particular is significant. The Bull was made to be a fighter by someone else, and when you use your Moment of Truth, the story of the Bull&rsquo;s origins becomes way more important. Use your Moment of Truth when you know you want to inject that element of backstory into the game moving forward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>You can change the subjects of The Bull&rsquo;s Heart pretty easily, which lets you make sure it&rsquo;s always pointed at characters you&rsquo;re interested in engaging. Other PCs are usually more interesting sources of drama and conflict than NPCs, but focus on the character relationships you find most interesting. If you aren&rsquo;t spending time pursuing either your rivalry or your love, then you&rsquo;re missing out. Also, keep in mind that your love doesn&rsquo;t have to be a romantic love, and your rival doesn&rsquo;t have to be hated. They absolutely can be if that&rsquo;s what you want! But they don&rsquo;t have to be so extreme. Your rival could be your closest friend whom you&rsquo;re determined to surpass. Your love might be someone who&rsquo;s like your younger sibling, and you keep them safe at all costs. Interpret those terms liberally&mdash;that&rsquo;s why The Bull&rsquo;s Heart roles, like Friend, still make sense. You would comfort or support your rival if they&rsquo;re not just an enemy. For Punch everyone, charging into a fight without hedging your bets means dashing into danger without any thought to your own safety or the safety of others. It needs to be meaningful that you aren&rsquo;t hedging your bets or thinking about what you&rsquo;re doing. Often, that means you aren&rsquo;t participating in the move to generate Team for the fight. There when it matters allows you to appear in a scene you weren&rsquo;t previously in&mdash;just work with the GM to explain how you got there so quickly. It could be anything from you just happening to be in the area to you actively tailing the person you protect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATION FOR THE BULL</h2>\n<p>Ms. America Chavez, YOUNG AVENGERS</p>\n<p>Superboy, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>X-23, X-MEN</p>\n<p>Molly Hayes, RUNAWAYS</p>\n<p>Hazmat, AVENGERS ACADEMY</p>"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"PIYJckcNzA7ukurN":3},"flags":{}}
