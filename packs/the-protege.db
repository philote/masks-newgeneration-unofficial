They think you&rsquo;ve got what it takes. They&rsquo;ve been training you for a while, and now you have to decide...do you want to be them? Or will you find your own path?</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Protege|page=1]{The Protege}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE PROT&Eacute;G&Eacute;</h2>\n<p>Focused, well-trained, driven, unsure. The Prot&eacute;g&eacute; is defined by two things: their training and their mentor. A Prot&eacute;g&eacute; has a level of skill and preparation beyond nearly any of the other PCs&mdash;even the Legacy wasn&rsquo;t necessarily as well-trained as the Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The Prot&eacute;g&eacute; might have innate powers, sure, but they were also guided in how to use those abilities and more by their mentor. That also means they&rsquo;re devoted to being a superhero in a way that none of the other PCs may be&mdash;a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; made at the start of play has been training for quite some time to get into this life. That said, the question before a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; is always whether this is really what they want&mdash;and, more specifically, if they want to wind up being their mentor. For better or worse, the relationship between you and your mentor is always one wherein your mentor wants you to turn out similarly to them&mdash;maybe not exactly the same, but close. And you have to decide if that&rsquo;s really what you want. Regardless of everything they&rsquo;ve given you, you might not want their life once you understand what it really means. Pay close attention to your choices for which Labels your mentor denies and embodies. In addition to telling you the kind of person your mentor likely is, they tell you the kind of person your mentor wants you to be. Make sure you spend time with your mentor. Return to them. Ask them for help and input. You might butt heads with them, you might resist what they choose for you, but they matter to you, as well. They gave you what you needed to become the person you are today, and your relationship with them is the source of your dramatic arc. They might seek you out, but you should do the same.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>For Been reading the files, you&rsquo;re assumed to be reading or otherwise learning about the superhuman world from your mentor&mdash;in whatever way fits their MO. You only trigger the move, though, the first time you encounter any given important superhuman phenomenon. You can&rsquo;t say you read a file about them during a later encounter. When you tell the team the most important detail you remember, you have a responsibility to stick to whatever fiction is already established about the world and this character&mdash;but otherwise, you can add whatever detail you want. The GM tells you if anything is different, meaning that they&rsquo;ll alert you if things have changed surrounding the detail you provided. The resources that your mentor gives you and the team are things that your mentor has access to and is willing to grant you. Ultimately, you&rsquo;re the arbiter of whether they go to the team, or if you keep them for yourself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATION FOR THE PROT&Eacute;G&Eacute;</h2>\n<p>Robin, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>Cyclops, X-MEN</p>\n<p>Batman (Terry McGinnis), BATMAN: BEYOND</p>\n<p>Aqualad, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>Wonder Girl, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>","hp":null,"load":null,"damage":""},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"PIYJckcNzA7ukurN":3},"flags":{}}
