Your home is an amazing place, full of beauty and wonder. But there&rsquo;s something to them, something special that you&rsquo;re missing back home. Something&hellip;human. So yeah, you&rsquo;ll be hanging around. At least for now.</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Outsider|page=1]{The Outsider}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE OUTSIDER</h2>\n<p>Strange, curious, na&iuml;ve, arrogant. The Outsider isn&rsquo;t from here, but that won&rsquo;t stop them from creating a life for themself right here on this planet. At least, for now. But can they find a place here? Will they even want to, once they get to know this world more? Or will they answer that siren call, and go home? When you make an Outsider, feel free to go nuts with your homeland. You might be an alien, absolutely, but you might also be from a parallel world, or from the future, or from a digital realm&mdash; whatever. The key is, wherever you&rsquo;re from, it has to be substantially different from Earth and Halcyon City, to the point that you don&rsquo;t fit in even when you try. A crucial thing to remember while playing the Outsider is that you aren&rsquo;t incompetent&mdash;you understand more than enough to get by in your new home. What you don&rsquo;t understand are the more complicated elements of the world around you. Pick a few key areas of different philosophy and psychology as you play your Outsider. You can add all the weird pieces you want&mdash;&rdquo;My people never let their feet touch the ground, and we can&rsquo;t see the color green, and we hear emotions!&rdquo;&mdash;but focus on important and difficult questions, like your people actively dismissing the idea of incarcerating criminals instead of reforming them or believing that those with great power are required to follow the will of the people.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>Belong in two worlds inherently implies that you have some status and power with your people. You also must have some method of contacting your people, whatever that might be for you. The hold you spend on pieces of tech or answers can represent benefits you&rsquo;ve gained over the course of your communication with your people, allowing you to say after the fact that they gave you technology or information during the conversation. Spending a hold to clear a condition through contact with home, however, is only appropriate when you&rsquo;re actually in contact with home. When you create a device with Alien tech, you still need human technology to build on. While whatever you build can do something impossible, it often does a limited version of it&mdash;choosing on a 10+ that the device works exceptionally well ensures that you get everything you wanted, and maybe more. If you take a Kirby-craft, its particulars are largely down to your fictional set up. How big is it? As big as you think makes sense. What does it look like? Whatever makes sense for your people&rsquo;s technology. Its strengths and weaknesses just tell you and the GM the important pieces about what the ship can do and how it can be damaged. If it gets damaged, you have to repair it to use it again. For Alien ways, what counts as an important Earth custom is ultimately up to you and the GM. As a guideline, a custom is important when undermining it has consequences and/or creates friction with those around you. If nobody cares if you undermine that custom, it&rsquo;s probably not all that important. For Not so different after all, remember that you have to actually do whatever options you choose. Make sure you let the other players know how you confess a flaw of your home, mislead them about your home, or describe the glories of your home during the conversation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATIONS FOR THE OUTSIDER</h2>\n<p>Miss Martian, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>Marvel Boy, YOUNG AVENGERS</p>\n<p>Xavin, RUNAWAYS</p>\n<p>Starfire, TEEN TITANS</p>\n<p>Warlock, THE NEW MUTANTS</p>"},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"7N8sxGQbJ9aRtbkZ"}
