You could probably have a safe, decent, simple life. It&rsquo;d be nice, but&hellip;come on. Superpowers! Aliens! Wizards! Time travel! You&rsquo;re out of your depth, but who cares? This is awesome. Everybody should try it.</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Beacon|page=1]{The Beacon}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE BEACON</h2>\n<p>Hopeful, excited, understanding, human. The Beacon is the most directly mortal and least strange of all the playbooks. They haven&rsquo;t been shaped by anything else&mdash;they could choose to leave this life behind, if they wanted. Which is exactly the point. They&rsquo;re here because they want to be here. They want to do this. And that gives them a purity compared to the other characters. You can expect NPCs to tell you that you don&rsquo;t really belong here. After all, you don&rsquo;t have those extras that most people associate with superheroes. A central conflict for the Beacon is proving yourself and making the case for why you actually belong. Ultimately, your character is all about their drives. Those give you objectives, things to aim towards and try to do, so make sure you pick drives that really interest you. Trying to accomplish your drives might lead you into trouble just as much as it might lead you to triumph, but they&rsquo;ll always push you toward that key conflict&mdash;do you actually deserve to be here? And that&rsquo;s exactly what you want.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>No powers and not nearly enough training requires you to pay attention to gear. Most other characters only care about stuff like ray guns and special devices when they&rsquo;re immediately dangerous, but you should be listening for cool stuff you can pick up whenever possible. Assessing the situation and Straight. Up. Creepin&rsquo;. are great ways to flag cool stuff you can use. Pretty much a superhero is your chance to control NPCs&rsquo; first impressions of you. It only triggers when you think the other character is actually important, and it lets you frame how they see you&mdash;though the GM can complicate it on 7-9. Whatever Label you pick is the one they reflect back at you through their Influence. Suck it, Domitian requires you to be dramatically under fire&mdash;that means the odds are against you, or you&rsquo;re up against some terrifying threat. If the situation&rsquo;s well in hand, chances are you&rsquo;re not dramatically under fire. Of course, you&rsquo;re often underpowered compared to your opposition, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to get there. Your drives work almost like an alternate advancement track&mdash;even if you aren&rsquo;t there yet on your normal advances, when they&rsquo;re all gone you have to change playbooks, retire, or become a paragon. If you retire or become a paragon, your character becomes an NPC. If you change playbooks, mark that advance like normal, and switch your character to the new playbook.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATION FOR THE BEACON</h2>\n<p>Kate Bishop, YOUNG AVENGERS and HAWKEYE</p>\n<p>Artemis and Arrowette, YOUNG JUSTICE cartoon and comic (respectively)</p>\n<p>Doug Ramsey, THE NEW MUTANTS</p>\n<p>Kamala Khan, MS.
