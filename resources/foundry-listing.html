  This module contains moves for the game Masks: A New Generation for use with
  the Foundry VTT generic PbtA System (<a

    target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener"
    >https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/pbta</a
  >). You can install this system with this link:

  This revised version of the module is based on works from multiple
  people:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The original created by brunocalado (<a
      href="https://github.com/brunocalado/masks-newgeneration-unofficial"
      target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow noopener"
      >https://github.com/brunocalado/masks-newgeneration-unofficial</a
    >)&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    A second version that was maintained by CyricPL (<a
      href="https://github.com/CyricPL/masks-newgeneration-unofficial"
      target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow noopener"
      >https://github.com/CyricPL/masks-newgeneration-unofficial</a
    >)
  </li>
  <li>
    A sheet module created by Geekswordsman (<a
      href="https://gitlab.com/geekswordsman/masks-newgeneration-sheets"
      target="_blank"
      rel="nofollow noopener"
      >https://gitlab.com/geekswordsman/masks-newgeneration-sheets</a
    >)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The current version is a merging of these modules' features, cleanup of the
  moves and bringing the module up to date with Foundry VTT versions and PbtA
  system versions.
</p>
<p>
  This module is a prerequisite for Masks: A New Generation Sheets (<a
    href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/masks-newgeneration-sheets"
    rel="nofollow"
    >https://foundryvtt.com/packages/masks-newgeneration-sheets</a
  >). This module can be used without that one, but it is a great module and is
  highly recommended.
