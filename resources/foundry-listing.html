  This revised version of the module is based on works from multiple people:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The original created by brunocalado (
      <a href="https://github.com/brunocalado/masks-newgeneration-unofficial" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" >
        https://github.com/brunocalado/masks-newgeneration-unofficial
      </a>)&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    A second version that was maintained by CyricPL (
    <a href="https://github.com/CyricPL/masks-newgeneration-unofficial" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">
      https://github.com/CyricPL/masks-newgeneration-unofficial
    </a>)
  </li>
  <li>
    A sheet module created by Geekswordsman (
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/geekswordsman/masks-newgeneration-sheets" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" >
      https://gitlab.com/geekswordsman/masks-newgeneration-sheets
    </a>)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The current version is a merging of these modules' features, cleanup of the moves and bringing the module up to date with Foundry VTT versions and PbtA system versions.
</p>
<p>
  This module is a prerequisite for Masks: A New Generation Sheets (
  <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/masks-newgeneration-sheets" rel="nofollow">
    https://foundryvtt.com/packages/masks-newgeneration-sheets
  </a>). This module can be used without that one, but it is a great module and is highly recommended.
